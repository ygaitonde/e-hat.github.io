I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, and a member of the [Future of Programming Lab](http://fplab.mplse.org/), where I work on [Hazel](http://hazel.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy [music of all sorts](https://open.spotify.com/user/8vy5jztitzgqw4u20p7m6gue9?si=10ba79e66dfd4448), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118012267-yash-gaitonde), and riding my bike.
