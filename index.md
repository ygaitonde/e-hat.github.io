{% include section-title.html words="about" %}

I'm a student at the University of Michigan, interested in programming languages, user interfaces, and startups.

I'm a researcher at the [Future of Programming Lab](http://fplab.mplse.org/), working on [Hazel](http://hazel.org/), a structure editor and functional language that can typecheck and run incomplete programs.

In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, listening to music, and skateboarding.
