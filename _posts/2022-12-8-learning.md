I'm using this page to keep track of the books I've been using as I continue my independent studies. All of these books have been incredible resources, and I highly recommend them.

### Practical Vim, by Drew Neil

I've been using Vim for 2 years at this point, until about 6 months ago inside VSCode, and more recently I've moved my entire development environment to neovim/tmux. This book taught me so much about Vim that I wasn't even aware of, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about switching over to Vim, as well as daily users who want to become more familiar with Vim's esoteric features.

### Designing Data-Intensive Applications, by Martin Kleppmann

Much has already been written about this book, but I highly recommend taking detailed notes as you read through. My notes on this book have already come in handy as I've begun to explore operating systems, architecture, and database internals.

### Beej's Guide to Network Programming

This is a really cool resource. I didn't want to spend a bunch of time learning about networking but wanted a primer for basic familarity. This book did a great job with that, and is also written in a very accessible and entertaining style. The only issue I had is that some of the C code is hard to read, with extremely short variable names and not much explanation.

### The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt

This is another classic text in software engineering. I found it to be a little outdated, but still valuable to refresh on non-technical aspects of software engineering which are easy to forget about. 

### Refactoring, by Martin Fowler

I highly recommend this book. Prior to giving it a read, I had a sense for when code needed refactoring, but this book gave me the ability to understand patterns formally, and gain a concrete sense of how to proceed with a refactoring once I've identified it's worth doing. Also, I thought the discussion of why messy code sometimes _doesn't_ need refactoring particularly valuable.
